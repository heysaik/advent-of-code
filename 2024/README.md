# Rust in 2024
For the end of 2024, I decided to learn Rust. Given its increasing popularity and versatile use with microcontrollers and servers (both of which I'm starting to learn more about), I felt like it would be a good time to learn this language.

And then a day after discovering [Comprehensive Rust by Google](https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/index.html), I discovered [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). So here's to ending the year by learning some new skills and solving some puzzles. Cheers ðŸ¥‚
